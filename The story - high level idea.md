Ideas for the SDC game:

1. Travel game
2. You travel to european places
3. The NPCs are SDC members that give you country-specific questions, if you get them right/wrong you get bonuses/maluses/sidequests
4. Various means of transportation have different tradeoffs
5. The objective is to reach Nijmegen from London
6. Need a way to "force" people to go throught europe
   1. Could be collecting things
   2. Could be limited traveling options
   3. Could be narrative (you get kidnapped)
