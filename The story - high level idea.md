Ideas for the SDC game:

1. Travel game
2. You travel to european places
3. The NPCs are SDC members that give you country-specific questions, if you get them right/wrong you get bonuses/maluses/sidequests
4. Various means of transportation have different tradeoffs
5. The objective is to reach Nijmegen from London
6. Need a way to "force" people to go throught europe
   1. Could be collecting things
   2. Could be limited traveling options
   3. Could be narrative (you get kidnapped)
7. Cheat code for Orla demo - TECHQUEEN - makes travel free

# Nonrandom randomness

Game has 3 phases:

1. UK
2. Europe except The Netherlands
3. The Netherlands

You roll a loaded dice that depends on how many people you've met

- If you haven't met enough you will not go to the next phase
- If you have met enough the probability will be very high

- random ?encounter? en route;
- random consequences, including:
  - losing money,
  - taking off at the wrong station,
  - getting the wrong tain/bus/whatever.

If you run out of money you do a jam on the road to collet quids
The jam will give you a random amount of money but always enough to get a new ticket.
